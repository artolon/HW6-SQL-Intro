## What is an RDBMS and what is SQL?

RDBMS is an abbreviation for ‘Relational database management system.’ Essentially, a RDBMS is a data ecosystem that stores collections of data tables. These data tables are comprised of columns (with field names) and rows (for individual records). The tables within the RDBMS are also related to each other in some capacity and can be organized in a ‘data model’ (a diagram that displays the relationships between and among tables). A helpful aspect of relational database management systems is that you can run SQL queries to quickly gain insights about your data. 'SQL' is an abbreviation for 'structured query language.' This coding language allows users to retrieve information, join, aggregate, and/or manipulate data tables within a RDBMS. SQL is also the standard language for relational databases, but there are different ‘dialects’ of SQL, depending on which type of RDBMS you are using.
